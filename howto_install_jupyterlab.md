# How to install Jupyterlab in Oracle Cloud (OCI) ?

The following walk-through guides you through the steps needed to set up your environment to run Jupyterlab in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.

## Prerequisites

You have deployed a VM 2.1 with Oracle Linux 7.9 (OEL7) in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI).

- The installation of Oracle Linux 7.9 is using pip3.6 by default. 
- Python 3.6 or higher is installed
- You have access to root either directly or via sudo. By default in OCI, you are connected like "opc" user with sudo privilege.

## Jupyterlab Installation

The install is pretty simple. It consists of setting up python, installing python components and libraries. 
Lets start with setting up the Python Environment

### Python Setup

By default, OEL7 runs Python 3. The first is to install pip and virtualenv.

#### Install virtualenv

The next step is to install virtualenv. Virtualenv enables us to create isolated sandpits to develop Python applications without running into module or library conflicts. It's very simple to install

```console
sudo pip3.6 install virtualenv
```

Next we can create a virtual environment and enable it.

#### Create an environment "myvirtualenv"

```console
virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3 myvirtualenv
# Activate the env
source myvirtualenv/bin/activate
```

#### Check list of Python Libraries in your environment

Running the following command will show what Python models we have installed at this point.

```console
(myvirtualenv) [opc@lab1 ~]$ pip3 list
Package    Version
---------- -------
pip        21.1.3
setuptools 57.1.0
wheel      0.36.2
WARNING: You are using pip version 21.1.3; however, version 21.2.1 is available.
You should consider upgrading via the '/home/opc/myvirtualenv/bin/python -m pip install --upgrade pip' command.
```

#### Upgrade your PIP Environment for this virtual environment

```console
/home/opc/myvirtualenv/bin/python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```
### Jupyterlab Setup

```console
pip3 install jupyterlab
```

#### Install Python Libraries for Machine Learning or ETL Process

```console
pip install pandas
pip install pandarallel
pip install dask
pip install seaborn
pip install matplotlib
pip install plotly

pip install -lxml==4.6.3
pip install selenium
pip install beautifulsoup4

pip install scikit-learn
```

#### Install other Python Libraries for Kafka Access and WEB Server Access

```console
pip install kafka-python (v2.0.0)
pip install Flask
pip install gunicorn
```

#### Install extensiones for Jupyterlab Environment

```console
pip install jupyter_contrib_nbextensions
jupyter contrib nbextension install --user
jupyter nbextension enable execute_time/ExecuteTime
```

## Configure Jupyterlab like a OEL7 Linux Service

Create a script to instantiate automatically and reboot jupyterlab with "opc" user.

```console
vi /home/opc/launchjupyterlab.sh
```


### Script for launchjupyterlab.sh

You must use the virtualenv created and you can launch Jupyterlab in a specific port (for example: 8001) and listen on public IP.

```console
#!/bin/bash

# Activate myvirtualenv Environment
source myvirtualenv/bin/activate

cd /home/opc

if [ "$1" = "start" ]
then
nohup jupyter-lab --ip=0.0.0.0 --port=8001 > ./nohup.log 2>&1 &
echo $! > /home/opc/jupyter.pid
else
kill $(cat /home/opc/jupyter.pid)
fi
```

### connect to "root" user

```console
sudo -i
```

### create a script to start, stop service "jupyterlab"

```console
vi /etc/systemd/system/jupyterlab.service
```


### Add next lines to launch like "opc" user the script "launchjupyterlab.sh"

```console
[Unit]
Description=Service to start jupyterlab for opc
Documentation=
[Service]
User=opc
Group=opc
Type=forking
WorkingDirectory=/home/opc
ExecStart=/home/opc/launchjupyterlab.sh start
ExecStop=/home/opc/launchjupyterlab.sh stop
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

### Test Jupyterlab Service

```console
systemctl start jupyterlab
systemctl status jupyterlab
systemctl enable jupyterlab
```

## Reboot Your machine to final check

Now, you must reboot your machine to check if jupyterlab script is enabled by default on port defined 8001.

You must open port 8001 to your virtual machine VM 2.1 in order to access using your Public IP.

```console
firewall-cmd  --permanent --zone=public --list-ports
firewall-cmd --get-active-zones
firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-port=8001/tcp
firewall-cmd --reload
```

If you're running directly on a virtual machine and have a browser installed it should take you directly into the jupyter environment. Connect to your "http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:8001/".
  
And you should see the next Python Web environment "Jupyterlab".
